## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously, even in educational projects. If you discover a security vulnerability in CryptoSentinel, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Email:** [saisrujanmurthy@gmail.com](mailto:saisrujanmurthy@gmail.com)

**Subject Line:** `[SECURITY] CryptoSentinel Vulnerability Report`

**Please Include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity (Critical: <7 days, High: <14 days, Medium: <30 days)

### Security Best Practices

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**

This project is designed for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. Many tools implement cryptographic algorithms that are:

- **Deprecated** (MD5, SHA-1)
- **Weak** (Caesar, Vigenère, Simple XOR)
- **For Learning Only** (All classical ciphers)

**DO NOT USE** these implementations for:
- Production applications
- Securing sensitive data
- Real-world cryptography

**For Production:** Use established libraries like:
- `cryptography` (Python)
- `OpenSSL`
- `libsodium`

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting:** Report vulnerabilities privately via email
2. **Coordinated Fix:** We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
3. **Public Disclosure:** After a fix is released, we'll credit you (if desired)
4. **CVE Assignment:** For critical issues, we'll work with MITRE for CVE assignment
